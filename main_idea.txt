The anomalious dataset from kitting experiment, which has been finished the preprocessing based on the specific classification filter scheme;
we address the problem of how to extract the valuable features from the multimodal time series;
The classification implementation would be valuated by some of the existing methods: KNN+DTW, svm, ...

The contribution would be three fold:
1. Feature extraction
2. Feature quality evaluation, which can be implemented by varying the number of extracted features or the significatance of each feature..
3. Sparse representation of the multivariate time series and without lowering the classifcation accuracy
